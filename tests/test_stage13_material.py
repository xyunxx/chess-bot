"""Stage 13: ``evaluate(board)`` reflects material and recognizes terminal positions.

We assert direction and rough magnitude on positions with a clear material
imbalance, plus the three terminal cases: White checkmated, Black checkmated,
and stalemate. Your piece values and other weights are your own choices —
the assertions below only pin down sign and order-of-magnitude, never exact
centipawns.
